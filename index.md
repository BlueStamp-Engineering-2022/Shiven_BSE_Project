# Emotive Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone, I soldered all the components of the WaveShield, the resistors, transistors, capacitors, microcontrollers, and the sd-card holder, and then attached the WaveShield to the Arduino board. Then using a breadboard I wired in an LCD display and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. If an object is placed in front of the ultrasonic sensor, it sends out a sound wave and tracks the amount of time it takes for the sound wave to get back, via code, and then uses the d= rt formula to determine the distance the object is away from the sensor. Then it displays it on the LCD display. If the object is farther than 300 cm away or if the object is too close, it will display an error.

# Starter Project
  

I worked on the Simon Says game. The microcontroller is the whys and hows of the game. It has been programmed to light up the buttons and create a sequence that you have to follow. Hence the name Simon Says. The capacitors store excess electrostatic energy that the board may not need for the game to work. The buzzer creates the sound in the game. The resistors tell the microcontroller not to reset the power once the game is turned on. The game can be turned on by using the switches. Essentially the job of the switch is to open the wire when off, so current cannot flow through the circuit, I enjoyed the soldering process, and I also enjoyed troubleshooting my always-on green light. I enjoyed using the Oscilloscope to determine if there was a difference in voltage between the other lights. I struggled to find out where I went wrong. I initially thought that when I was soldering, I caused the two ends of the LED light to be connected, and therefore the light would always be on. However, it turned out to be that the problem was that I had overridden the in-built resistor causing the current to travel through the shortest path, which bypassed the resistor and resulted in the LED light always being on.
